# Diggerzz-DAO
Hack The Mountian 3.0 Hackathon

Diggerzz DAO is the worlds first decentralized community of Archeologists and Historians , where they can share their discoveries and findings with archelogists around the worls, without the external influence of any political regulation, tampering in research quality and facts and  social media influence .Due to decentralized governance, every DAO member as an equal opportunity to cast their votes- Eg. To descide the ranking of researchs by the archelogists for the archelologists .

Unique Features :
 - Store your findings permanantly on the blockchain .
 - Earn NFT's for your research contributions.
 - Collaborate with other archelogists around the globe.
 - Open to everyone, general audience can join to get free access to unmodified and altered -pure research papers.
 - Mint your research papers as an NFT !
 - Number of Research-NFT's minted can be determined by the ranking on every research based on voting!
 - Allow patrons to admire your research by buying your minted NFT's :-)
 
 Current Implementation Status w.r.t Hack the Mountain 3.0 :
 -Implemented and deployed functional frontend webpage
 -Connected webpage to metamask
 -Succesfully Implemented and tested Whitelist Smartcontract on Goerli Test Network.
 -Succesfully developed Whitlelisting Dapp.
 
 Features we missed to add :
 - IPFS storage for Join Dao forms for Archelogist and General Members.
 - Deployment of Whitelist dapp & adding to the webpage
 - Voting system for decentralized governance.
 
 What's our wow factor :
 - Altough we were unable to implement the ahead mentioned feature, we etched a way to limit the research NFT's mintable for every Archeologist - based on the rank of research paper attained w.r.t the voting done by the Dao members(researches and archelogists).

# WhitelistDapp

 **[Click here to see how the Dapp works](https://youtu.be/kj-IvrLT-9w)**
 
 
 **Note - While the code was already tested locally during HTM 3.0, the deployment of the Dapp using vercel was successful afer the Hackathon**



Dapp for whitelisting  the early members of the DAO community, by adding their name to the whitelist to airdrop them Genesis(Ealry) contributor NFT's


## How it works

 - The smartcontract is written to allow first 10 unique addresses to join the whitelist.
 - Pay the gas fees to enter the whitelist ~ via metamask.
 - Address which is added to the whitelist already, cannot be added once again.To avoid multiple entries with same address.
 - The max number of whitelisted addresses allowed are 10
 - Throws an error if number of whitelisted address is greater than maximum allowed.
